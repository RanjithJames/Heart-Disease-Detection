# Heart-Disease-Detection

Objective
Build the a machine learning model for the heart disease detection

Approach :

- Clean the Data
- Run Lazypredict to try a range of diffrent algorithims
- We realize the models suggested do not generalize over all the data
- Use H20 Automl to find optimized models

### Packages and Tools Required:
```
Pandas 
Lazypredict
h2o
Collab
